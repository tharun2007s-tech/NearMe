<h>VELLORE FORT PARK</h>
<p>Vellore Fort Park is not a distinct location but rather refers to the expansive grounds within and around the historic Vellore Fort, a 16th-century granite fort known for its grand ramparts, moat, and significant historical attractions. The area features lush gardens and lawns for leisure, alongside cultural sites like the Jalakandeswarar Temple, the Archaeological Survey of India Museum, and historical buildings now housing government offices and the Tamil Nadu Police Training Center. Visitors can enjoy walking tracks, explore the fort's architecture, and take in panoramic views of the surrounding area.  </p>
